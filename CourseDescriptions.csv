Over the next 50 years, however, writers and artists in this Midwestern city produced their own brand of modernism. This seminar examines how such artists and writers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries â€œvisualizedâ€ an alternative modern aesthetic. Combining artistic, historical, and literary perspectives, students will study how this modernism was represented on the page and on the canvas. By exploring advancements in composition, color, design, sound, lyric, and language, we will consider the role the Midwest played in shaping modernist art, architecture, and literature. Students will have the opportunity to study the papers of famous and not-so famous writers, thinkers, artists of the period helping them to visualize and construct modernism themselves. The course will follow a chronological and thematic scheme to introduce topics around modernism in art and literature, specifically in the context of Chicago. Several excursions will be organized so students can experience the spaces under consideration and consider how the space functions differently today than it did one hundred years ago.

The course begins with consideration of the history of the geosciences as a discipline. We discuss modes of thinking that are shared with other scientific disciplines as well as those unique to the geosciences, and we read seminal papers that shaped the development of the field. With the guidance of a faculty member, each student identifies a topic to investigate in depth. Students lead discussions, prepare literature reviews and give final presentations on their topics. The topic a student explores in the junior seminar may be (but is not required to be) the same as the one studied intensively in the Senior Capstone course (GEOS 620). For some students, the junior seminar topic may also be linked to a research project to be continued over the summer and/or through the student's senior year as an independent study or honors project.

Topic for Winter 2025: Reading India  PREREQUISITES: None  The economist Joan Robinson once observed that “whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true.” But how – and with what consequences – can such a polity hang together? This discussion-based course offers a non-major friendly introduction to the political history of this country of contradictions: How was secular democracy established and contested in this extraordinarily diverse and deeply-divided society? What impact has deepening political participation and economic transformation had on entrenched inequities along caste, class, gender, and religious lines? How, if at all, might the study of India inform the way we think about “tradition” and “modernity”? Although we will focus on India’s political history after independence, readings will cover a range of topics and will be drawn from a variety of genres. Assignments will include regular, short writing and research tasks designed to complement course readings, and students will be introduced to some core concepts and theories in comparative political science along the way.  Topic for Winter 2025: Dream Cities  PREREQUISITES: None  This course examines key ideas that have shaped cities over time, exploring what these theories can contribute to today’s efforts to make cities more sustainable, vibrant, and inclusive.

We will learn to critique colonial-era primary source materials including musical works, traveler’s accounts, and images. We will also engage a wide variety of secondary sources, including postcolonial and decolonial scholarship, indigenous perspectives, and contemporary performances, that engage with colonial pasts and presents.  Topic for Winter 2025: Musical Myths and Fictions  In this seminar we will dig into the idea of “classical music” as a “social fiction,” complicating the standard music history narrative that links together such dissimilar musics as Gregorian chant, opera, chamber music, and avant-garde experimentalism into an overarching “tradition.” In addition to considering big questions about grand narratives and the ideology of the Western classical canon, we will investigate some of the enduring clichés about classical music and musicians and debunk some of the popular myths attached to specific composers, works, and legendary performers in order to understand what these compelling music history fictions reveal about the values and interests of the institutions and individuals who perpetuate them. Throughout the course, we will explore the complexities of writing and transmitting history, focusing our attention on excerpts from music history textbooks and score anthologies, as well as scholarly articles and essays.
